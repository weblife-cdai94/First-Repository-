Game Development 1

Through this gaming development course I plan on creating a fully functional game. I want to create a game that is very fun and entertaining. I want to create a game for everyone to play, with this game i want to  be able to leave a great impact on all gamers around the world. I want to create a game with a strong story line that have players excited for what comes next.
